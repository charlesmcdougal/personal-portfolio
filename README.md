# personal-portfolio
Thank you for checking out my personal portfolio.

Everything I did here was coded by me. I didn't want to use any 3rd-party code for this as a sort of personal challenge to myself. There are still lots of things I want to change and lots of things that are probably going to be buggy, but I wanted to get it out there for people to see.

This project is licenced under the MIT licence, which is shared in the main directory. Feel free to do what you'd like with the code, just remember to keep the licence with it.
